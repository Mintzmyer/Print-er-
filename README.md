Interactive Learning Environment - A virtual world of modifiable code for learning to program in Python

This project aims to explore pedagogy in gaming by providing a world users interact with by programming.
The current goal is a proof-of-concept by the end of 2018. This entails:
  - Creating a project in Blender with a few basic objects and mechanics (complete)
  - Exploring and implementing a way to update objects code at runtime (in-progress)
  - Expand the ui and objects to showcase and demo code changes (upcoming)
  - Integrate a rudimentary IDE into the UI to modify code in-app (upcoming)

In 2019, the project will build on this foundation adding:
  - User-generated "levels" (really, tutorials)
  - Deeper UI integration with documentation, forums, etc

This project targets two passions of mine: (1) reducing exclusivity to programming/STEM by making it
accessible to more diverse approaches, learning styles, backgrounds and interests, and (2) pushing
myself to learn new technologies and grow the skills I need to accomplish ever-increasing challenges.
Print(er) represents the most technically ambitious scope and largest scale of projects so far.
Fortnightly sprints will pace the work into doable chunks.

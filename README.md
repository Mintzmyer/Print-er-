# Print-er-
Print(er): Python Visualizer

Summary: A self-directed project to motivate practicing repository use and code tracking, blender exploration, and scrum practices.
It aims to develop a virtual environment, where users interact with objects by viewing and modifying their python code. This is both a creative and pedagogical mechanic for exploratory learning.
